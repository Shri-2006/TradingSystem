#ATR is the normal volatility for threshold scaling. if live atr exceeds limit the kill switch threshold wides to avoid being triggered by regular noise while if below threshold will tighten to protect capital and profit.
#ATR is average true range, which measures how the asset price changes on average per day. it checksvolatility by looking at the biggest high minus low, high minus previous close, low minus previous close, then gets average over 14 days.
