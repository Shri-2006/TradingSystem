# SinghQuant: Multi-Strategy Trading System with ML and Risk Management

## Overview
A multiple strategy algorithmic trading system that compares grid trading, momentum breakout, and reinforcement learning across stocks and crypto with backtesting on historical data, keeping risk metrics, and having a live dashboard through Streamlit

## Strategies
**Stable:** Stable is intended to go for longer term gains and to be careful of going on short risks in stocks/etfs
**Risky1:** Risky1 is intended to go for short term gains in the stocks markets, going high risk high reward
**Risky2:** Risky2 is intended to go for short term gains in the cryptocurrency markets, going high risk high reward.

## How the ML Works
This system currently uses three different types of machine learning:
| | Supervised Learning | Reinforcement Learning |
|---|---|---|
| **Used by** | stable, risky1 | risky2 |
| **How it learns** | Learns from labeled historical examples (past BUY/SELL outcomes) | Learns by trial and error in a simulated environment |
| **What it needs** | Historical price data with correct answers | An environment to act in and receive rewards/penalties |
| **Output** | Predicts BUY or SELL for the next bar | Decides HOLD, BUY, or SELL based on current state |
| **Strength** | Fast to train, interpretable, works well on stable patterns | Can learn complex multi-step strategies, handles position management |
| **Weakness** | Struggles when market regimes change | Takes much longer to train, harder to debug |
| **Algorithm** | XGBoost | PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) via Stable Baselines3 |
| **Why this algo** | Industry standard for tabular financial data, outperforms random forest and linear models | Most stable RL algorithm for discrete action spaces, less prone to collapse than DQN |

### Why not unsupervised learning?
Unsupervised learning (clustering, anomaly detection) has no concept of BUY or SELL — it finds patterns but can't make trading decisions on its own. It could be used as a feature layer on top of supervised learning in a future version, but is not the right primary model for a trading system.

### Signal Flow Per Strategy
Raw price data (Polygon.io)
→ build_features() — RSI, ATR, Bollinger Bands, momentum, etc.
→ regime_detector() — is the market trending, ranging, or volatile?
→ VIX + SearXNG macro check — is the macro environment safe?
→ ML model prediction — XGBoost (stable/risky1) or PPO (risky2)
→ risk_manager() — position sizing, stop loss, ATR-adjusted kill switch
→ equity_curve_filter() — is the bot itself on a cold streak?
→ execute trade via Alpaca

## Tech Stack
Alpaca - allows for paper trading and live execution for all bots
Polygon.io - Stock/ETF price data for stable and risky1, and crypto price data for risky2
SQLite- SQL database provider

VectorBT- Engine to test models on historical data
Streamlit - Live dashboard to see performance
SearXNG - self-hosted macro news search via HuggingFace Space
FRED API - live VIX data for macro fear signal
SAP AI Core - AI classification for ambiguous macro signals
Google Gemini - fallback AI classifier

## Setup
**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, Git

**1. Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shri-2006/SinghQuant.git
cd SinghQuant
```

**2. Install dependencies:**
```bash
bash setup.sh
```
Note: `setup.sh` installs requirements then handles the alpaca/websockets version conflict separately. Do not use `pip install -r requirements.txt` directly.

**3. Create your `.env` file:**
ALPACA_API_KEY=
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=
POLYGON_API_KEY=
SAP_AUTH_URL=
SAP_CLIENT_ID=
SAP_CLIENT_SECRET=
SAP_AI_API_URL=
SAP_ORCHESTRATION_DEPLOYMENT_ID=
RESOURCE_GROUP=default
GEMINI_API_KEY=

**4. Train the models:**
```bash
python3 models/train.py
python3 -c "from models.rl_train import train_rl_model; train_rl_model(ticker='X:BTCUSD', days_to_look_back=365, timesteps=500000)"
```

**5. Run the system:**
```bash
nohup python3 -u run.py > bot.log 2>&1 &
```

## Deployment
- **Live on Oracle Cloud ARM** (`129.213.134.186`) — 4 CPUs, 24GB RAM, always free
- Dashboard coming soon at `129.213.134.186:8501`
- Azure VM (`172.203.220.50`) — stopped, previously used for deployment

## Progress

### In Progress:
- Streamlit dashboard on Oracle Cloud
- Port 8501 firewall setup on Oracle

### Completed Parts:
- core/config.py - This provides the configuration of the system and what are the providers
- core/logger.py - Creates database and provides functions to initialize the database tables, log each trade, and get past trades from database
- core/features.py- shared feature engineering for all 3 strategy bots. Computed rolling averages, RSI, momentum, Bollinger Bands, ATR, z-score, and volume indicators from raw data with open, high, low, close, volume data.
- data/polygon_fetcher.py - fetch historical and live data relating to stocks and etfs from polygon.io, adding crypto support
- data/sentiment_fetcher.py - fetch sentiment analysis from news articles using TextBlob and put into scores column in df
- models/regime_detector.py - detect whether market is trending or ranging, market regime detection using ADX (threshold 25, SMA fallback for <14 bars), VIX macro signal from FRED API (>30 blocks risky bots), get_vix() function
- models/train.py — XGBoost training pipeline for stable and risky1. It will fetches historical data, builds features, creates BUY/SELL labels, trains model, and saves the model as a .pkl file
- models/retrain.py — scheduled retraining every 14 days
- backtesting/engine.py — VectorBT backtesting engine, generates BUY/SELL signals from ML model, runs backtest with 0.1% fees and slippage, returns total return, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown
- backtesting/run_backtest.py — runs backtests across all strategies
- metrics/risk.py — Sharpe ratio (with live US Treasury rate fetch),max drawdown, win/loss ratio, compute_all_metric adn wrapper
- metrics/risk_manager.py — per-trade risk: stop loss, position sizing, peak equity kill switch, warning/critical thresholds, ATR-based dynamic threshold scaling
- metrics/equity_curve_filter.py — macro trading state filter: reconstructs equity curve from closed trade history, computes moving average and drawdown, returns FULL/THROTTLE/HALT state with position size multiplier. Called once per cycle in stable.py and risky1.py before the per-ticker loop
- strategies/stable.py - stable bot trading loop with full risk stack wired in
- strategies/risky1.py - risky1 bot trading loop with momentum exit and full risk stack

There is small penatly for overtrading and nudges to exit loser positions. Drawdown traced per step is a hook for a future kill switch integration for this.
- models/rl_train.py - PPO training pipeline for risky2. It fetches a year's worth of historical crypto data, builds features and trains agent using MlpPolicy for 500000 timesteps. The model will be saved in risky2_model.zip

- tests/test_atr.py — 17/17 passing
- tests/test_regime.py — 15/15 passing
- setup.sh — handles dependency installation including alpaca/websockets version conflict
